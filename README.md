## Candidate Selection Process - Machine Learning Project

The pre-assessments consist of a series of surveys to be completed by the Church Planter and spouse and twelve other people designated by them as observers. These observers are individuals who know the couple well and can attest to their personality traits, strengths, and weaknesses in the areas of marriage, ministry, and work.
 
This project examines the current pre-assessment process by looking at data from the last three years. It applies statistical analysis and ML methods, particularly of classification, to the existing pre-assessment data to evaluate the effectiveness of the current process, highlight the most significant features in the dataset, and develop an algorithm that learns from the input provided to classify new observations.
 
The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that can be used to measure the efficacy of the pre-assessment surveys in determining who should be endorsed as Lead Church Planter.
