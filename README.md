## Candidate Selection Process - Machine Learning Project

This project develops a ML classification model trained on the results of the in-person interview as target labels to predict whether a candidate is likely to be given the “ready” score based on the results of the pre-interview survey. The ML model will be deployed in a web application using Flask. 

The model evaluates the effectiveness of the current pre-interview survey in determinig the likelihood of a candidate being selected for endorsement and funding. It applies statistical analysis and ML methods, particularly of classification.
 
The datasets will be evaluated using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN as classification models. Nested vs. Non-Nested cross validation will be used to determine the best approach and Random Forest Feature Importance to select the most important features.
